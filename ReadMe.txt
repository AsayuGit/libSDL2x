This is a port of SDL 2 to the orignal Xbox.

The port is still in pre-beta stages as it has only been tested with the LazyFoo SDL2 samples (lazyfoo.net)
and my port of DevilutionX. A few things are still missing (as below).

Todo:
- Separate alpha blend.
- YUV texture support (mostly used for video playback?).
- Need to get TextInput working.
- No onscreen keyboard.
- Missing SDL hidapi subsystem (is this likely to be used for ports to Xbox tho?).

Note: None of the SDL 2 addons are included in this repo atm.

Special thanks to Lantus/MVG and Hyper_Eye, their work on the SDL 1.2 port helped alot with this port.

Cheers
